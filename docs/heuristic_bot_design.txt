Heuristics & Bot Strategies for Uros

Definitions:
"Adjacent" always means orthogonally adjacent.
An "island square" is a square on an island.
A "Lake square" is a square on an island that is on the Lake.
A "Reedbed square" is a square on a Reedbed island.
A "Reedbed village" is a connected group of adjacent houses of one colour, on a Reedbed island, that has an
expansion front of size > 0.
Any village's "expansion front" = every empty island square which is adjacent to at least one house in the village.

Metrics needed by bots, to evaluate the board state:
(The "size" of something means the number of island squares it comprises.)
Your BVL = The size of your biggest village on the Lake.
Your EFL = The size of the expansion front of your biggest village on the Lake.
Your BVR = The size of your biggest Reedbed village.
Your EFR = The size of the expansion front of your biggest Reedbed village.
Opponent's BVL = The size of your opponent's biggest village on the Lake.
Opponent's EFL = The size of the expansion front of your opponent's biggest village on the {ake.
With any of these, if the player has more than one candidate for "biggest village", choose the one that has the
biggest expansion front.
If still a tie, choose one randomly between them to be the player’s "biggest village".

Metrics to be reported at end of a game:
The winner's BVL, and the loser's BVL.
Was the winner player 1 (the start player) or player 2?
Which tiles were left in the Reedbed, unplaced?

How a Bot uses heuristics
Each different bot will follow its own strategy, by using the same main heuristic, but weighting the parts according to
its own priorities.
i.e. The bot will:
- Calculate the current value of these 5 metrics:
your BVL, your EFL, opponent's EFL, your BVR, your EFR.
- Consider the possible legal placements. (Ignore pointless house placements, i.e. Don’t place onto a Reedbed
island when that island can no longer fit onto the lake.)
- For each possible placement:
- - Examine the new game state that would result from that placement.
- - Calculate the value of the 5 metrics for that new game state.
- - Calculate the amount that each metric would therefore change by, if that placement were made. (Each change
will be an amount like +2 or -1.)
- - Then calculate that placement's score as follows:
Score = (A * change in your BVL) + (B * change in your EFL) - (C * change in opponent's EFL)
+ (D * change in your BVR) + (E * change in your EFR)
...where A, B, C, D and E are weightings set by the bot according to its priorities.
- The bot then makes the placement that has the highest score.
If there are several placements with the same highest score, the bot will choose randomly between them.

The Bots and their Strategies:
"Balanced" (an all-round approach)
A = 5, B = 3, C = 4, D = 0.2, E = 0.1
"Explore" (prioritise extending potential territory)
A = 5, B = 4, C = 3, D = 0.2, E = 0.1
"Expand" (grab territory whenever available)
A = 6, B = 3, C = 3.5, D = 0.2, E = 0.1
"Exterminate" (deny territory to opponent)
A = 4, B = 3.5, C = 5, D = 0.2, E = 0.1
"Exploit" (make opponent place the islands)
A = 5, B = 3, C = 4, D = 1, E = 0.5
